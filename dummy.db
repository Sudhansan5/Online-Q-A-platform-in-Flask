1	2020-12-20 05:12:00.449386	There are many, many reasons that made python popular, I can only name a few.\r\n\r\n1. Easy to read code, free of needless special characters and parentheses. Enforced identation (love it or hate it) leads to wells structured code and reduces the number of bugs that might be created by ambigous if-else statements for example.\r\n\r\n2. One way to do things (and often times: One and only one way)\r\n\r\n3. Batteries included philosophy: There are tons of packages that come with each Python installation, and tens of thousands more available on the web.\r\n\r\n4. Reasonable performance for a scripting language: By itself not terribly fast Python provides and easy way to call foreign functions that have been written in C or another execution-speed optimized language. Furthermore it is possible to compile Python code, increasing speed further.\r\n\r\n5. Open source (and no doubts about it): Users do not have to worry about any patent nonsense or licence payments that may or may not be due in the future\r\n\r\n6. Developed by one (very few actually) people. As opposed to a whole committee where the many compromises necessary will very often degrade the quality.\r\n\r\n7. Once it was popular it became more popular (I bet there is a far more elegant way to express this...): Once a language or technology has reached a certain adoption rate, a disproportionate ammount of books, tutorials, courses and technologies building on it appear. Increasing its popularity even further.\r\n	2	2
2	2020-12-20 05:16:01.069734	There wont be a permanent solution anytime soon.\r\n\r\nAs of now, Astrazenca-Oxford University produced vaccine candidate has entered phase 3 of clinical trials. Studies have shown that it triggers an excellent immune response, with twice the number of antibodies being produced.\r\n\r\nModerna (US) has currently suspended its phase 3 trials, reason remain unknown. It might be due to the fact that phase 2 results weren't satisfactory.\r\n\r\nHere in India, phase 1 trials of indigenously produced Covaxin were started, so still months to go before we hear any news on it.\r\n\r\nFew days back, Russia's Sechenov Institute announced that their Vaccine is completely safe and complied with the current standards. Turns out the test was done on a mere 38 people. Hmmm…\r\n\r\nPfizer-BioNtech have been given a whopping 1.95 billion Dollars after encouraging results of phase 1 and phase 2 trials.	1	2
5	2020-12-20 05:19:45.227305	Python is a very straightforward programming language that you can study without much direction. This programming has a very clean syntax and various importantly, an extensive library. The main reason for its fame is because of its large user interface which has created an actual feedback loop.\r\n\r\nThis programming language is essentially used for various purposes including website and internet development, scientific and numeric computing, software development, educational purposes, scientific data, organizational tools and much more	2	3
6	2020-12-20 05:21:38.86944	The answer matters on what do you mean by software. If it's mobile application then sorry Python is not so famous for mobile computing. May be there is framework like kivy exist but this is not the field where Python dominates.\r\n\r\nBefore coming to desktop software we have to understand today's so called 'software' doesn't depends on single language, at least when it scales as a Giant. Microsoft's desktop software market is dominated by .net and Java. But I can tell you a name of popular game where Python is being used, and the game is Battlefield. When we look into Linux then you will get many software needs Python and Pyqt to run themselves.\r\n\r\nNow coming to web apps. This is the platform where Python is most successful. May be you are having a great conversation with a charming chatbot, posting on Pinterest, Reddit or Instagram, watching YouTube video , searching on google, watching advertisement related to your need, then you are using Python and these are the most popular 'Python Software' or 'Software' we use.	3	3
7	2020-12-20 05:22:23.60702	The "which is better" debate about Django and Flask seems to go on and on. Either one will be an excellent choice.\r\n\r\nFor the beginning programmer, both Flask and Django offer excellent learning materials and communities that are generous in sharing their knowledge. As you become more experienced you will find that you will tend to become more comfortable with the environment you have chosen. You can do web sites of any size in either. Both offer large programmer communities and work opportunities, and both look like they will be with us in the future. If you have chosen Django, you will tend to solve problems in a way reflecting how you think about Django. The same with Flask. As you become an advanced programmer in either, you will be able to do whatever you need to do to create the result you want without wishing you had chosen the other environment.\r\n\r\nGiven how I tend to program, I have learned ways of doing things here and there from Django, but I lean toward Flask. On the other hand, I know many Django programmers who are quite satisfied with how they do things.\r\n\r\nI would recommend that you program a small project in Flask and in Django. You can find a tutorial in either one and translate it to the other. Do something requiring a full stack from client to web server to application server to database/data server. Add ajax, authentication, authorization and some asynchronous capability if you like. See which one feels more comfortable to you as you get the various components talking to each other and choose it.	4	3
8	2020-12-20 05:23:37.907797	They both serve a different purpose, there is no better or best\r\n\r\nDjango is the full featured framework, with batteries included and has great plugin support.\r\n\r\nFlask is the DIY framework, which through plugins can do the same as Django, and has no batteries included. Do you want a login, you can build it yourself or use a plugin like Flask-Login. It’s up to you to do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nFlask is a lot easier to learn then Django, since Django requires you to do it the Django way and requires you to do some configuration before getting started. But it comes with the batteries included. There is no best, the only best is the thing that works for you and your project. If you just need a simple edit page/order form, you might want to look at Flask. If you do not want to get your hands dirty and mind some overhead for that project Django might be the way.\r\n\r\nI prefer Flask myself, since I am alot more free, But you have to look at it from project to project and the needs you have. On a current project I am working on we are using both. Django for some legacy thing and Flask for something new. Why does the legacy thing uses Django ? At that time it was the thing that company needed with the batteries included and they got up and running very fast.	4	1
